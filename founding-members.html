                            <p>It's no small achievement to distinguish oneself in such diverse fields as commerce,
                                education, and philanthropy. Pujya Shriman Karamshibhai Jethabhai Somaiya, born on May
                                16 1902 in the remote village of Malunjar in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, India,
                                was however, a blessed person by dint of hard work and singular devotion to service.
                            </p>
                            <p>Born to humble beginnings, he rose to become one of the doyens of the industry in Western
                                India. The young Karamshi, after completing school at the New High School in Mumbai (now
                                the Bharda School) went back to his hometown in Ahmednagar embarking on a career of
                                tireless work marked by singular devotion to whatever he did.
                            </p>
                            <p>Young Karamshibhai Somaiya began his career by engaging in his father's small grocery
                                business and then went on to become a partner in a leading sugar trading firm in the
                                area while continuing to nurture his dream of contributing to the creation of a
                                resurgent India – a vision painted by Mahatma Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda.</p>
                            <p>In the 1939 Shri K.J. Somaiya launched two sugar factories in Sakarwadi and Lakshmiwadi.
                                He soon came to be known as the Sugar King of India. At the age of 60 he relinquished
                                the leadership of his economic enterprise to his son Dr. Shantilal Somaiya, and fully
                                immersed himself in social service. No sketch of Shri K. J. Somaiya can be complete
                                without mentioning his philanthropy. More information on K. J. Somaiya available at
                                Outreach section of Somaiya Group website (www.somaiya.com).
                            </p>
                            <p>Shri K.J. Somaiya was warm and endearing. Stately in appearance, immaculately dressed,
                                generally in spotless white hand spun khadi, he exuded a picture of resourcefulness and
                                restraint. He was compassionate and reached out to those in suffering. In all he did,
                                Karamshibhai brought a sense of love and humanism, qualities imbibed in his early youth
                                from the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi. He believed in the ancient Sanskrit saying
                                (Namanushit Parodharmah). "There is no religion greater than Humanity". Karamshibhai's
                                life exemplified this lofty principle through practice.
                            </p>
                            <p>Shri Karamshibhai Somaiya passed away on May 9, 1999, a week before his 97th birthday.
                                Somaiya Vidyavihar is the living legacy he has left behind, a standing monument to his
                                sagacity, perseverance and foresight.
